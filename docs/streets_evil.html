                <h3>Sister Miriam Godwinson, "The Blessed Struggle"</h1>
                <p>The righteous need not cower before the drumbeat of human progress. Though the song of yesterday fades into the
                    challenge of tomorrow, God still watches and judges us. Evil lurks in the datalinks as it lurked in the streets
                    of yesteryear. But it was never the streets that were evil.</p>

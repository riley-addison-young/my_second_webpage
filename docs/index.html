                <p>I started programming in high school, then went on to study Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>
                <p>After getting my bachelor of science degree, I moved to Chicago and worked nearly a year as an Android Developer contractor for a company that specialized in developing internet ordering systems.</p>
                <p>After my contract was over, I moved back to California, where my family lives.</p>
                <p>Right now, I am actively looking for my next software engineering job, and I am open to relocation.</p>
                <p>When I am not job hunting, I work part-time in the nearby grocery store and take classes online to keep my skills sharp and broaden my skillset.</p>
